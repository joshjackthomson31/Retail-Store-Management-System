Concepts used:
I used read and write system calls to read or write a file.
I used file locking to ensure that 2 persons cannot access the same product. 
Used socket programming to communicate between client,server and viceversa
Files used:
server.h contains definition of all functions in server does
server.c  Contains implementation of all functions to be done by server
server_main.c Used to accept clients from clients
client.h Contains definition of all functions to be done by client
cilent.c Has implementation of all functions to be done by client
client_main.c Used to connect to clients
data.h Contains the structure of product
data.c Writes initial data to a file

Steps to run:
First execute data.c to get initial data
Run server in one terminal using "cc main_server.c server.c" command
Run clients in any other terminal using "cc main_client.c client.c" command
For a given person, the options that relate to him will be displayed.
We can choose any of the options and execute them. 

Logic: Whenever a client needs to communicate with server, I used socket programming. Locks are implemented whenever admin accesses the products. They are also implemented when an user enters payment gateway. When I lock an product, I am updating the file and asking the user for required amount. Payment is succeeded if user pays the required amount is typed and the products requested by user are present in the shop. The one who pays first will get access to the product first.
